event loop is like a controller between the :
- Stack 
- Web API 
- Task queue 

when the task goes from stack to web api like the setTimeOut it goes through the 
timer in the webapi while other tasks are being finished in the js .

js is actually a single threaded language which means it can only run one task at a time .

after the timer is finished in the web api the task can't dirctly be sent to the stack so it goes
to the task queue , where the EVENT LOOP checks if the stack is empty or not , if it's empty 
the task goes to the stack and executes . 

Simple that's the job of event loop , like a traffic police guiding the tasks towards the empty stack.
